# 3D Print files

Here are some of my 3D print files projects.


# MSXPico-Part.3mf

A case for the MSX Pico cartridge made by Jeroen: https://github.com/jeroentaverne/msxpico?tab=readme-ov-file
I created this back of the case for Sony HB-F[5,7,9]00[B,D,F,P,S] MSX computers.
Those machines have the Cartridge slot 'upside-down' and you are looking at a plain back side without logo.
This design also makes it possible to print the MSX Pico logo with another color.
And if you have some soldering skills you could add some extra LED's which light up when Music is playing via the MSX Pico.
