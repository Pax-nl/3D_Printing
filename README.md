# MSXPico-Part.3mf

A case for the MSX Pico cartridge made by Jeroen: https://github.com/jeroentaverne/msxpico?tab=readme-ov-file
I created this back of the case for Sony HB-F[5,7,9]00[B,D,F,P,S] MSX computers.
Those machines have the Cartridge slot 'upside-down' and you are looking at a plain back side without logo.
This design also makes it possible to print the MSX Pico logo with another color.
And if you have some soldering skills you could add some extra LED's which light up when Music is playing via the MSX Pico.

(this is the back part only and the logo is still upside down as my Sony MSX is mounted on the wall :D, send me a message if you need the logo mirrored)
